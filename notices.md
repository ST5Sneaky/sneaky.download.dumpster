## Notices

1: **NO ONE** will **EVER** be allowed to upload files to my dumpster **UNLESS THEY ARE ALLOWED**.

2: This dumpster will be **MALWARE-FREE**. No malware here. If you were looking for malware, none here.

3: Text files **MUST** go in the Tests category.

EXCEPTIONS: NON-HARMFUL MALWARE, LIKE GDI IS ACCEPTED.

## Considers

Malware:

Malware is okay if it does NOT do any of these.

1: Overwriting the MBR (master boot record)
Malware here WILL NOT overwrite the MBR. That makes your OS useless.

2: Encrypting files, unless it is the Windows Encryptor (windows encrypted files have a lock on it)
Malware here WILL NOT encrypt files unless it is the Windows Encryptor.

3: DOES ANYTHING TO DAMAGE THE USER'S COMPUTER.
This is already explainable.
