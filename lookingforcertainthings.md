## Malware
My dumpster is COMPLETLY MALWARE-FREE, but if you were looking for malware, here you go.

If you don't know what malware is, Malware is a type of software that can take over your computer and completely destroy it, like with NoEscape.exe at the end, the malware does an MBR (master boot record) wipe. Which after that, your computer IS NO LONGER bootable again. So, if you want to mess around with malware, I highly recommend you use a [VM.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) VMs are very easy to learn, and all you need to do is find a OS ISO file that you want to use for your VM, then insert it, and then boot it up and install and you're done! Good job. But if you are using a real computer, I highly recommend that you don't click on the link ðŸ˜‰
